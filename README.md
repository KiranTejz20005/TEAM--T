## üßæ Problem Statement

Financial professionals face recurring challenges:

1. **Fragmented Data Sources:** Data required for analysis exists across PDFs, Excel files, CSVs, and APIs.
2. **Manual Effort:** Analysts spend significant time extracting tables, reconciling figures, and writing narrative commentary.
3. **Errors and Ambiguity:** Reports often contain numeric mistakes and unclear statements without clear provenance.
4. **Weak Audit Traceability:** Reviewers struggle to verify the source of figures or insights.
5. **Slow Context Integration:** Peer benchmarks and scenario analyses are time-consuming to incorporate.

FinMDA-Bot automates these tasks to improve efficiency, accuracy, and auditability.
