## Simplified Problem Statement
Financial data is messy and scattered everywhere‚Äîin PDF reports, Excel files, and live market websites‚Äîmaking it incredibly difficult and time-consuming for anyone to get a clear picture of what's going on. The core problem is that traditional tools can't understand how the text in a report explains the numbers in a spreadsheet, forcing analysts and individuals to manually piece everything together, which makes it hard to spot important trends or get quick, intelligent answers to financial questions.


## Existing Solution
### High-End Professional Platforms (like Bloomberg Terminal)
These are powerful, all-in-one computer systems used by finance professionals. They provide real-time financial market data, news, in-depth analytics, and the ability to execute trades, all within one secure network.

### AI-Powered Spreadsheets (like Copilot in Excel)
This is an AI assistant built directly into spreadsheet programs like Excel. You can use plain English to ask it to analyze the data in your sheet, create formulas, generate charts, identify trends, and clean up messy data.

### General "Chat-with-Your-Doc" Tools (like PDFGPT)
These are tools where you upload a document (like a PDF), and an AI reads it. You can then ask questions in a chat window to find information, get summaries, or extract key points directly from the document's text.

### Document Extraction APIs (like Google Document AI)
This is a background tool for developers, not a standalone app. Its job is to "read" unstructured documents (like scanned PDFs or invoices) and automatically pull out specific data, turning it into organized, structured information (like a table or a list).


## How it's different from the Existing solution
### vs. High-End Platforms (Bloomberg Terminal):
 These are like a space shuttle: incredibly powerful, but you need to be a trained astronaut (a professional trader) to use them, and they cost millions. Your bot is like a smart, affordable car: it's designed for everyone else (startups, individuals) to get the financial insights they need easily and affordably.

### vs. AI-Powered Spreadsheets (Copilot in Excel):
 Copilot is smart only inside its Excel file. It can't read the 50-page PDF report you have that explains why the numbers in the Excel sheet are a certain way. Your bot understands both the PDF's text and the Excel's numbers and knows how they relate to each other.

### vs. General "Chat-with-Your-Doc" Tools (PDFGPT):
 These tools are like a simple search function. They can find the word "revenue" in a PDF you upload, but they have no idea what "revenue" means. Your bot is a financial expert. It doesn't just find the word; it understands the concept, calculates the revenue trend, and charts it for you.

### vs. Document Extraction APIs (Google Document AI):
 These are just background tools, like an engine for a car. They are not a car. They are a single component that can only extract raw data. Your bot is the complete, finished product: it uses that engine (your "Document Intelligence") and then adds the steering wheel (the chat), the GPS (the financial analysis), and the dashboard (the charts and KPIs) so you can actually use the information.

## Architecture & Techstack
### 1. Frontend:

* **Framework:** `React`
* **Purpose:** To build the chat interface where the user uploads files and asks questions.
* **Key Libraries:**
    * `axios`: For sending messages and files to your backend.
    * `react-dropzone`: To handle drag-and-drop file uploads (PDFs, Excel).
    * `plotly.js` or `recharts`: To draw the interactive charts and graphs.
    * `react-markdown`: To display the bot's formatted answers (with bold text, lists, etc.).

### 2. Backend:

* **Framework:** `Python` with `FastAPI`
* **Purpose:** To act as the "traffic cop" that receives requests from the frontend and sends back answers from the AI.
* **Key Libraries:**
    * `fastapi`: The main library for building your high-speed API.
    * `uvicorn`: The server that runs your FastAPI application.
    * `python-multipart`: Needed by FastAPI to process the file uploads.

### 3. AI & Data Processing:

* **Core Technology:** `Python`
* **Purpose:** To read documents, analyze data, and generate answers.
* **Key Libraries & Concepts:**
    * **Document Reading (Document Intelligence):**
        * `pandas`: **The most important library** for reading and analyzing `Excel` and `CSV` files.
        * `openpyxl`: A helper library that `pandas` needs to read `.xlsx` files.
        * `PyMuPDF` (or `fitz`): The best library for quickly extracting text and tables from `PDFs`.
    * **AI Orchestration (The "Glue"):**
        * `langchain` or `llama_index`: **Essential.** This framework connects all the pieces. It builds the RAG pipeline and creates the "agent" that can use tools (like `pandas`).
    * **RAG & LLM Integration (The "Reasoning" Loop):**
        * **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation):** This is the *process*. When you ask a question, `LangChain` first *retrieves* relevant text chunks from your `pgvector` database.
        * **LLM (The `openai` or `llama` model):** The LLM receives the retrieved text *and* your original question. It uses this context to generate a relevant, factual answer.
        * **Agentic Tools:** For numerical questions, the LLM *writes and executes* `pandas` code to get a factual answer (like a profit margin), which it then uses in its final response.
    * **Core Models (The "Intelligence"):**
        * `openai`: The official library to use `GPT-4` or `GPT-4o` as the LLM.
        * `sentence-transformers`: To create "embeddings" (vector numbers) for the RAG system, allowing you to use open-source models like `Llama 3`.
    * **Data Science (For advanced analytics):**
        * `scikit-learn`: For the "trend predictions" feature.
        * `numpy`: A core dependency for `pandas` and scientific computing.

### 4. Data Storage:

* **Database:** `PostgreSQL` (for production) or `SQLite` (for easy local setup).
* **Purpose:** To store the "embeddings" (the vector memory) of the documents you upload.
* **Key Extension:**
    * `pgvector`: This is an **extension for PostgreSQL**. It's what gives your database the "superpower" to store and search for vector data (i.e., your document's memory).
* **Key Python Libraries:**
    * `sqlalchemy`: Helps `LangChain` talk to your database.
    * `psycopg2-binary`: The Python "driver" that lets you connect to PostgreSQL.

### 5. Deployment:

* **Service:** `Render`
* **Purpose:** The cloud platform that will host your live app, database, and backend.
* **Key Technology:**
    * `Docker`: (Highly Recommended) A tool to "package" your entire backend (Python, libraries, etc.) into a clean box called a container. Render can run this container directly.
    * `requirements.txt`: The simple file that tells Render all the `pip install` libraries your Python backend needs.
