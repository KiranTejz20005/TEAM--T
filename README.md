# FinMDA-Bot — Unified Financial Analyst

FinMDA-Bot is an AI-powered financial assistant designed to unify, analyze, and interpret financial data from multiple sources including PDFs, Excel, CSV, and market APIs. The bot automates extraction of key financial metrics, generates explainable MD&A-style narratives, and produces auditor-ready reports—dramatically reducing manual effort, improving accuracy, and ensuring traceability.

## 💡 Project Overview

Financial analysis is often a slow, error-prone process. Analysts spend hours collecting data, reconciling figures, and drafting narratives, while auditors struggle to validate claims due to poor traceability. FinMDA-Bot addresses these challenges by providing an end-to-end automated solution for:

- **Data integration:** Consolidates financial data across multiple formats and sources.
- **Intelligent analysis:** Computes KPIs and provides peer benchmarking.
- **Explainable reporting:** Generates MD&A-style reports with evidence-backed narratives.
- **Audit readiness:** Ensures numeric and narrative traceability to source documents.

## 🧾 Problem Statement

Financial professionals face recurring challenges:

1. **Fragmented Data Sources:** Data required for analysis exists across PDFs, Excel files, CSVs, and APIs.
2. **Manual Effort:** Analysts spend significant time extracting tables, reconciling figures, and writing narrative commentary.
3. **Errors and Ambiguity:** Reports often contain numeric mistakes and unclear statements without clear provenance.
4. **Weak Audit Traceability:** Reviewers struggle to verify the source of figures or insights.
5. **Slow Context Integration:** Peer benchmarks and scenario analyses are time-consuming to incorporate.

FinMDA-Bot automates these tasks to improve efficiency, accuracy, and auditability.
